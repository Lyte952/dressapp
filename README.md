On login, the app checks your current weather based on your location, and suggests the right clothing to wear, else if the current weather is ok for you,

You can swipe left and right through the suggestions.

The avatar is animated to flex and show off swag in the drip. Whilst turning around in 360 degrees from left to right for the user to get a better view.
